The Birthday paradox shows us that in a group of N people, the odds 
that two of the have matching birthdays is surprisingly large.
This program does a Monte Carlo simulation (that is, repeated random 
simulations) to explore this concept.
      
(It's not actually a paradox, it's just a surprising result.)
